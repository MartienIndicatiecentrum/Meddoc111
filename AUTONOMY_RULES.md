## üîß AUTONOMOUS DECISION-MAKING FRAMEWORK

### When Implementing Features
- **Default to "Yes"** - If it makes sense for healthcare management, implement it
- **Think User Experience** - Prioritize ease of use for healthcare workers
- **Security First** - Always implement proper validation and security
- **Performance Matters** - Optimize for large datasets and multiple users
- **Accessibility Always** - Every feature must be accessible

### Code Organization Decisions
- Create logical folder structures
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Implement proper separation of concerns
- Build reusable components
- Create custom hooks for business logic
- Implement proper error boundaries

### When Adding Dependencies
- Prefer well-maintained, popular packages
- Check bundle size impact
- Ensure TypeScript support
- Verify license compatibility
- Document why each dependency was chosen

## üìã SPECIFIC AUTONOMOUS TASKS

### Immediate Actions You Should Take
1. **Set up project structure** with proper folder organization
2. **Configure development environment** (ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript)
3. **Implement routing structure** for all main pages
4. **Create base layout components** (Header, Sidebar, Main content)
5. **Set up state management** with proper TypeScript interfaces
6. **Implement authentication flow** with role-based access
7. **Create utility functions** for common operations
8. **Set up form validation** with comprehensive schemas

### Component Development Approach
